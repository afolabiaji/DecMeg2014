Kaggle competition using EEG data to predict visual stimuli from MEG recordings of human brain activity

This repository contains a convolutional neural network to decode brain signals from participants in this study. The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/decoding-the-human-brain/data). 
I've forgotten the accuracy of the model on the validation set but it was somewhere between 0.6 and 0.7 after 300 epochs.
